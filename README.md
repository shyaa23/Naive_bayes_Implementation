# Naive Bayes algorithm implementation from scratch

**1. Introduction**


This repository makes use of SMS spam collection dataset which consists of a collection of 5574 labeled SMS text messages. The main goal here is to implement the Na√Øve Bayes algorithm to create a spam classifier (filter). K-Fold cross validation was used to evaluate the model. The dataset was split into five equal
partitions where one fold was used as test set and the remaining folds were used as training set.The model evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall as well as confusion matrix were
then used to evaluate its performance.
